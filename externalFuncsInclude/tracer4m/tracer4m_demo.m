%% tracer4m - traces calls to methods and functions 
% This contribution presents a small tool to trace calls to methods and functions. There 
% was no tracing tool for Matlab to find on the Internet and still isn't?  
%
% The entry, "Adding Debugging Code Without Changing Your Code" at the blog "Ken & Mike 
% on the MATLAB Desktop" a couple of years ago gave me the idea to make a tool myself. I 
% have used and modified it since then. 
%
% A tracing tool may help learning OOD/P
%
% * understand the control flow of an application, e.g. demos, examples, etc. 
% * test your own code - are the methods called in the order they should
%      
% Now, my concern is: What is required of a tracing tool to become realy useful? Matlab
% provides the functions needed to implement a lot of functionality in a tracing tool.
% However, it must be robust and easy to use otherwise it will not be used. 
%
% I would appreciate comments regarding requirements on a tracing tool for Matlab.
%  
%% Context
% Object-oriented design is about distributing responsibilities among interacting objects.
% The objects should be small and focused. This results in a complex flow of calls. 
% Furthermore, in a GUI the user manipulates controls, which in turns trigger events and 
% chains of calls to methods and functions. Together this makes a significant difference 
% compared to procedural programming. It is easy to get lost when stepping through an 
% object-oriented code with the debugger. Thus, it is a bit of a challenge to design an 
% object-oriented GUI-application for the first time. The second time too, I fear. 
%  
% I try to follow some advices of www.mockobjects.com: 
%
% * Test driven  
% * Decide on some key classes and assign responsibilities
% * Decide on minimal interfaces of the classes
% * Make a "Walking Skeleton" - an absolutely minimum of the whole system that 
%   is executable. The flow of calls is the primer concern.  
% * Add and test details incrementally    
%
%% Problem
% * Matlab lacks a tool to trace calls - which methods are called an in which order. The
%   profiler does not provide that information.
% * The Matlab debugger and error reporting system knows little of what's going on once
%   listeners are invoked by the function notify. The error message doesn't even tell
%   which method failed.
%
%% Intent
% * Make a small and simple tool that traces calls 
% * The tool shall support debugging and unit testing  
%
%% Solution
% * The key to the solution is to use side effects of "dbstop in mfile at line if tracer",
%   where tracer always returns false. A break is set in the beginning and end of every
%   method and function.
% * "meta.class.fromName( name )" provides information on methods.  
% * "mlint( '-calls', filespec )" provides line numbers. ('-calls' is undocumented)  
% * dbstack provides the names of called and caller
% * tracer4m consists of a class named, "TracerHistory", and a function, "tracer".
%
%% Discussion
% There are various tools for other languages that do tracing of calls and much more. 
% Not until now I did some googling and found various documents and discussions, most 
% of which are ten to fifteen years old. I guess that since then tracing of calls is a 
% standard feature in most programming IDE (e.g. log4j).  
%
% The Matlab function, publish, uses side effects of "dbstop in mfile at line if foo". 
%
% TraceHistory is a singleton - only one instance executes at one time. Two 
% application running simultaneous will produce one shared log of calls to their methods.
%
% The tool leaves conditional breakpoint in the code. That is by purpose because I want 
% to be able to inspect them. That can easily be changed. Conditional breakpoints are 
% set at the first and last executable line of the methods. If there already is a
% breakpoint in one of these positions that breakpoints is removed (/overwritten).
%
% Certainly, tracing hurts the performance. However, performance will not be affected 
% when tracing is off.   
%
% In situations with callbacks interrupting running callbacks the tracing may change 
% the behaviour of the code. There might be more scenarios of that kind.
%
% The method, TraceHistory/setup, is made with unit testing in mind. When studying an  
% existing code it might be more appropriate if the files involved are found 
% automatically.
%
% tracer4m does not include calls to methods defined in superclasses, which might 
% cause confusion. 
%
% Broadcasts with notify ought be included in the trace. 
% 
% Strictly speaking, tracer4m doesn't trace calls, but methods being invoked. 
%
% The tool does *not* require extra code in the system under test.   
%
%% Demonstration of usage and behaviour
% I use the topic, "Example — Using Events to Update Graphs", of the Matlab on-line  
% help to demonstrate tracer4m. The classes fcneval and fcnview are found in the folder 
% matlabroot\help\techdoc\matlab_oop\examples. The help explains in detail how to run 
% this example. 

feobject = fcneval( @(x,y) x.*exp(-x.^2-y.^2), [-2 2 ] );
fcnview.createViews( feobject );    % createViews is a static method
%%
% Disable two of the four plots to limit the output of this demo. Return to the demo by
% typing "dbcont<Enter>".  
keyboard

%%
% Create a logging object and set up fcneval and fcnview for tracing. The method, 
% createViews is defined in a separate file (what's the point of doing that?) and 
% need to be set up as well.

log = TraceHistory.Instance;
log.setup( { 'fcneval', 'fcnview', 'createViews' } )

%%
% The next step in the example in the example will cause calls of methods

feobject.FofXY = @(x,y) x.*exp(-x.^.5-y.^.5);

%%
% Guess which methods where called! 

disp( log )

%%
% Looks ok to me. However, I have not studied the example thoroughly enough to be sure.
% That's the problems with test, one must know the result beforehand. Or consult an 
% oracle. 
%
% Exercises: When 
% feobject.FofXY executes which methods are called in what order? Firstly, find that out
% by inspection of the code. Secondly, figure it out by stepping through the code with 
% the debugger. Run
%
%       feobject = fcneval( @(x,y) x.*exp(-x.^2-y.^2), [-2 2 ] ); 
%       fcnview.createViews( feobject ); 
%
% set a breakpoint, dock the figure to keep it visible and run
%
%       feobject.FofXY = @(x,y) x.*exp(-x.^.5-y.^.5); 
%
% Did tracer4m get the trace right?
%%
% Now, clear the log to and do the next step in the demo. 

log.clearHistory
feobject.Lm = [-8 3];
drawnow
disp( log )

%%
% This too looks ok, but why did the text appear before the plots? That was the last 
% command of this example. 
%
% There isn't a method of TraceHistory to remove the registered files, thus I use dbclear.

dbclear all  
delete( gcf )
clear( 'tracer', 'TraceHistory', 'fcnview.fcnview' )
clear( 'fcnview.createViews', 'fcneval.fcneval' )
clear( 'feobject', 'log' )
disp('That should clear all tracer4m stuff')
disp(' ')

%% 
% *Output in the wrong order.*
% The tracer output above is created by disp(log) in the last line of this cell!   
% PUBLISH inserts the output in the wrong place. That's because of the bug "#496201,   
% Summary: Publishing a MATLAB file containing subfunctions: sometimes the output 
% appears in the wrong place in the document." - I guess. 
% 
% tracer4m can trace calls to functions in ordinary m-functions. 

log = TraceHistory.Instance;
log.setup( { 'testfile4tracer' } )

testfile4tracer(); 

disp( log )

%%
% This is correct, i.e. the output of disp(log) that appear in of the previous cell. 
%
% The method, TraceHistory/get, returns the cell array, which it uses internally to 
% log the calls reported by tracer. The cell array contains two columns per call, the 
% first is created at the beginning of the method and the second at the end. The rows 
% contain in order:
%
% * the name of the caller
% * the name of the method/function being called
% * ID - with handle objects an unique ID might be important (not yet implemented)
% * Time of creation of handle objects that have a property named, created (doesn't work 
%   any longer )
% * 'begin' / 'end'
%
% trace4m can be integrated in automatic tests. The code needed in the test will be 
% something similar to this 

rpt = log.get;
assert( any( strcmp( 'testfile4tracer/nested_02', rpt( 2, : ) ) )   ...
    ,   'tracer4m_demo:NoCallToMethod'                              ...
    ,   'The method, "%s", was not called'                          ...
    ,   'testfile4tracer/nested_02'                                 )

%%
% *The End*
